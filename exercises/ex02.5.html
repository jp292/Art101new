<p> <h2> Task #1 </h2>
I found task 1 to be fairly easy, <span class="high1"> mostly because all the instructions were laid out for us.</span> The biggest <span class="high2"> challenge</span> I had with task 1 was making sure I placed the added instructions in the right location. At first, I did not place all the other code between the body tags and had to take some time to realize what I was doing wrong. 
<h2> Task #2 </h2>
For task 2, I just went with my first thought. I have recently visited the Monterey Bay aquarium and was inspired by that! I wanted to do more with my code it was a bit difficult. I had a vision of adding more images and positioning them around the page to make it look more like open water, but I could not figure it out. I also do not really like that the background image <span class="high1"> repeats.</span> I am not sure if that is a mistake on my part or if there is a code to make it fill the page <span class="high2"> (I’m sure there is).</span> Other than that, I enjoyed having the freedom to create something of my own with the skills I’ve learned so far. 
<h2> Collaboration </h2>
My collaboration with my partner was great! We discussed themes for our first task and ideas on phrases and images to use. We communicated if we had any questions and discussed the topics shared in class.
